# Academic Mini Projects Repository

This repository contains my academic and practice mini-projects from various subjects, including:

- DAA (Design & Analysis of Algorithms)
- Linux
- PL/SQL
- Python

Each folder includes the project source code and a brief note explaining the logic and outcome.

This repo serves as a central place to store and track my learning progress across different technologies.
